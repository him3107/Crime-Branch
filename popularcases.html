		<b>MYSPACE CATCHES A MURDERER</b>

		MySpace has played an important role in helping Oakland police apprehend a 19-year old man accused of shooting a San Leandro High School football player Greg "Doody" Ballard, Jr.
		
		Oakland police had a street name of a suspect and were able to identify Dwayne Stancill, 19 of Oakland from a picture they found on a gang's MySpace page.

		<b>OFFICIAL WEBSITE OF MAHARASTRA GOVERNMENT HACKED</b>

		The state government website contains detailed information about government departments, circulars, reports, and several other topics. IT experts working on restoring the website told Arab News that they fear that the hackers may have destroyed all of the website’s contents.
