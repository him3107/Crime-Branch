		<h2>Advantages of Cyber Laws</h2>
		<br><br>
		The IT Act 2000 attempts to change outdated laws and provides ways to deal with cyber crimes. We need such laws so that people can perform purchase transactions over the Net through credit cards without fear of misuse. The Act offers the much-needed legal framework so that information is not denied legal effect, validity or enforceability, solely on the ground that it is in the form of electronic records.
		<br>
		In view of the growth in transactions and communications carried out through electronic records, the Act seeks to empower government departments to accept filing, creating and retention of official documents in the digital format. The Act has also proposed a legal framework for the authentication and origin of electronic records / communications through digital signature.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>From the perspective of e-commerce in India, the IT Act 2000 and its provisions contain many positive aspects. Firstly, the implications of these provisions for the e-businesses would be that email would now be a valid and legal form of communication in our country that can be duly produced and approved in a court of law.</li><br>
			<li>Companies shall now be able to carry out electronic commerce using the legal infrastructure provided by the Act.</li><br>
			<li>Digital signatures have been given legal validity and sanction in the Act.</li><br>
			<li>The Act throws open the doors for the entry of corporate companies in the business of being Certifying Authorities for issuing Digital Signatures</li><br>
			<li>The Act now allows Government to issue notification on the web thus heralding e-governance.</li><br>
			<li>The Act enables the companies to file any form, application or any other document with any office, authority, body or agency owned or controlled by the appropriate Government in electronic form by means of such electronic form as may be prescribed by the appropriate Government.</li><br>
			<li>The IT Act also addresses the important issues of security, which are so critical to the success of electronic transactions. The Act has given a legal definition to the concept of secure digital signatures that would be required to have been passed through a system of a security procedure, as stipulated by the Government at a later date.</li><br>
			<li>Under the IT Act, 2000, it shall now be possible for corporates to have a statutory remedy in case if anyone breaks into their computer systems or network and cause loss.</li><br>
		</ul>
		<br>
		 The remedy provided by the Act is in the form of monetary damages, not exceeding Rs. 1 crore.
